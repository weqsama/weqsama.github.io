            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
            
            <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>

            And I felt him to be more fragile still.

            <span class="underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as is he himself were a flame that might be extinguised by a little puff of wind...</span>
